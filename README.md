# Panopticon Project

## Nomenclature

For many different reasons, nomenclature is difficult when it comes to APTs. [Here](https://twitter.com/FDjoes/status/1181264949961805824) is just one example. Below is an attempt to build up a reference for people to refer to. There is a lot of overlap and this will be continually updated over time to reflect as accurately as possible the different names of APTs and APT overlap.

APT1 = [Comment Crew, Unit 61398](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html)

APT2 = [Putter Panda, MSUpdater](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0024/)

APT3 = [UPS Team](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html)

APT4 = [Maverick Panda, Sykipot Group, Wisp](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html), [Samurai Panda](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/samurai_panda)

APT5 = [DPD, Keyhole Panda, Poisoned Flight, TG-2754](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles)

APT6 = doesn't seem to have an alias

APT7 = doesn't seem to have an alias

APT8 = [APT20, Violin Panda, Twivy](https://threatmodel.venafi.com/groups/VG0008/) according to tertiary sources but I've found no primary source that lists both APT8 and APT20 as the same group.

APT9 = [Nightshade Panda, Flowerlady, Flowershow](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/nightshade_panda) however unable to find a primary source to confirm this.

APT10 = [Stone Panda, Menu Pass](https://adeo.com.tr/en/adeo_annual_threat_report/), [Red Apollo, CVNX, Potassium](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32020D1127&from=EN), [Cicada, Cloud Hopper](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage)

APT20 = Violin Panda, [Twivy](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html), [APT8](https://threatmodel.venafi.com/groups/VG0008/) according to tertiary sources but I've found no primary source that lists both APT8 and APT20 as the same group.

APT25 = [Uncool, Vixen Panda, Ke3chang, Sushi Roll, Tor](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html) The consensus online seems to be that vixen panda is APT15, but FireEye have them listed here as APT25. There is very little online about aliases for APT25.
